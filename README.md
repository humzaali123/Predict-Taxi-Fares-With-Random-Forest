# Predict-Taxi-Fares-With-Random-Forest
Use regression trees and random forests to find places where New York taxi drivers earn the most

This Project was completed on DataCamp.

# Project Description

In this project, you get to work with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013. You will use regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time.

The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, which was originally obtained and published by Chris Whong.

6. It's time. More predictors.
7. One more tree!
8. One tree is not enough
